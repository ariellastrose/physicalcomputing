For this assignment I had to build a control panel with a switch that allowed me to turn the lights on and off. I started off with assembling all of the wires, LEDs, resistors, and switches on the breadboard and arduino. Afterwards, I typed a code that allowed the lights to behave in the correct manner using the example that was provided in the textbook.
