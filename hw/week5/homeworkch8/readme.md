For this assignment I had to build a digital hour glass, a device that measures time using LEDs that light up every 10 minutes that pass. I started off with assembling all of the wires, LEDs, resistors, and switches on the breadboard and Arduino. Afterwards, I typed a code that allowed the device to behave properly using the example that was provided in the textbook. I encountered a few problems while building the device. The first time I ran it, the lights wouldn't work at all. After a brief inspection I found that one cord wasn't completely hooked up because it was too short. After I replaced it with a proper cord, the device began to work. I also had a problem with the switch that I was not able to resolve. For some reason, the switch did not fit into the breadboard and I wasn't able to use it to reset the LEDS.
