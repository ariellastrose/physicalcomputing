For this assignment I had to build a light-based theremin, a device that produces sound depending on the amount of light it comes in contact with. I started off with assembling all of the wires, LEDs, resistors, and switches on the breadboard and Arduino. Afterwards, I typed a code that allowed the device to behave properly using the example that was provided in the textbook. This project went smoothly and I was able to get the device working without any problems. The screeching noise was jarring at first, but it's cool that was able to control it by using my hand to cover the photoresistor.
