For this assignment I had to build a temperature sensor that could detect the heat of my skin. I started off with assembling all of the wires, LEDs, resistors, and switches on the breadboard and Arduino. Afterwards, I typed a code that allowed the sensor to behave properly using the example that was provided in the textbook. It was a little difficult at first to detect if the sensor was working, but this could be due to me forgetting to calibrate the device. Future work on this project would include a calibration in order to ensure more accuracy with the device.
