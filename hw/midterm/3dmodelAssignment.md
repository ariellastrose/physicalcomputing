<h1>Project Casing</h1>
<p>I had gone through many possible casing ideas before I finally settled on a clean, modern, and simplistic design. Before, I had considered housing the light in a party hat to give off more of a fun and playful vibe.  However, I didn't like how the light would work. I wanted a simple design that I could imagine being in someone's modernly decorated apartment. While browsing online, I encountered <a href="https://www.lightology.com/index.php?module=prod_detail&prod_id=156196">pictures</a> that fit what I was imagining perfectly.</p>
