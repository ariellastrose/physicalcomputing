##Idea 1
Motion Sensor Light for a room
When the light detects motion it will turn on, when it doesn't detect motion it will automatically shut off. I will need to hook my arduino up to a motion sensor (PIR) and insert an LED.

The setup would be somewhat like this: https://drive.google.com/file/d/14WTkqUBmcOmOHvDgO3E9bWZUvZiRSQTA/view?usp=sharing

I could potentially have the light turn different colors based on the interval of time that it doesn't detect motion


##Idea 2
Light that turns on when you emit a sound, like a clap
When the device detects a sound that is a certain amount of decibels, it will turn on. The same light will only turn off if it detects a noise around a certain amount of decibels as well. I will need to hook a sound sensor up my breadboard and insert an LED.

The setup would look similar to this: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1otrqbPj5ElrsiQDz0DEtF7-oXQqHztyy/view?usp=sharing

I could have the light change different colors based off of the decibels that the sensor receives or the cadence of the sound (two claps can turn it blue, three can turn it green, etc)
